Postscript file to generate dot grid note paper. Parameters in the PS provide some opportunity to adjust the grid. 

Properties I was keen to getâ€¦

* Completely black and fairly fine dots. Easy to see, but also easy to ignore.
* Additional structure in the dots so it is easy to follow lines accross the page and thus allign things. This is done with a major grid and a minor grid.
* Centering the major grid on the paper.
