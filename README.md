# What is this?

A postscript file (.ps) to generate dot grid note paper. The postscipt is failrly hackable; you can chnage the parameters in it to somewhat tweak what you get for your needs.

The grid here is 2.5mm pitch with larger squares at 1cm and 6cm.

# The goals

* Note paper I can use in landscape or in portrait.
* A grid made of dots instead of squares, because dots can almost vanish away.
* Mulitiple levels of grid.
* Fully black and fairly fine dots. Easy to see, but also easy to ignore.
* Additional structure in the dot grid, or multiple grid levels. I want it to be easy to follow lines accross the page. I want to be able to use a larger grid as a kind of tabs or to section the paper in to main notes and side notes or diagrams. I want the grid to let me align grid like things if I draw those.
* I want the largest grid centered on the paper.

# What's here?

There's a hacakble postscript file and a pdf generated from it with [ghostscript](https://www.ghostscript.com)'s `ps2pdf` tool.
